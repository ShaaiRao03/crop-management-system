- **Soil Management**: Segmented into initiation and monitoring phases. This module facilitates the observation of soil health pre- and post-crop planting.
  
- **Resource Allocation**: Users can manage equipment and inventory together with detailed insights into equipment upkeep.
  
- **Tutorial**: Educational resources such as videos and articles are accessible to users.
  
- **Settings**: Basic account settings are available for user customization.

## Case Study and Motivation

Our selection of Case Study 5, Green and Crop Management, stems from the pivotal role of agriculture in Malaysia's economy. Given the nation's heavy reliance on imported crops like wheat and rice which was also documented by the International Trade Administration (International Trade Administration, 2021). This fosters interest in farming through user-friendly solutions while offering educational insights into farm management.

Accordingly, our team has emphasized three primary objectives: streamlining crop management processes, providing educational support, and ensuring inclusivity and accessibility. Our farm management system encompasses features enabling task, pest, soil, resource, and inventory management, augmented by tutorial resources in the form of videos and articles.
